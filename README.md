# Medical-Data-Wrangling-Clinical-Trial-Comparison-of-Novodra-and-Auralin
This project involves data wrangling, assessment, and cleaning of clinical trial data to compare two medications: Novodra and Auralin. The primary goal is to prepare real-world medical data for further analysis by handling missing values, inconsistent formats, and data duplication.

# 🧪 Medical Data Wrangling – Clinical Trial Comparison of Novodra and Auralin

This project focuses on wrangling and cleaning messy clinical trial datasets to prepare a clean, analysis-ready dataset for comparing two diabetes medications: **Novodra** and **Auralin**.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The project uses 3 CSV files:
- patients_clean.csv: Contains patient demographic details
- treatments_clean.csv: Includes treatment records and outcomes

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Clean and standardize inconsistent data (e.g., names, zip codes, states)
- Handle missing values and duplicates
- Merge datasets to build a final dataset for clinical trial comparison
- Prepare the data for further analysis and visualization

---

## 🔧 Data Wrangling & Cleaning Tasks

- Removed null and duplicated entries
- Standardized inconsistent formats (e.g., capitalization, zip codes)
- Merged supplemental data to enrich the dataset
- Created clean versions of all datasets
- Exported clean datasets for analysis

---

## 📊 Final Output

- Cleaned and merged dataset ready for statistical comparison
- Dataset prepared for visual analysis 

---

## 📌 Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add data visualizations (bar chart, pie chart, treatment success rate)
- Perform statistical analysis to compare treatment effectiveness
- Deploy cleaned data for web-based dashboards (Plotly/Dash/Streamlit)
